## Circuit specs

https://hackmd.io/7GR5Vi28Rz2EpEmLK0E0Aw

## Running

- Depends on [Circom](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/)
- Depends on [Snarkjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snarkjs) `npm i -g snarkjs`

``` sh
./scripts./build-circuits.sh <rln|nrln>
```

## Benchmarks

System specs:
- Processor: `2,6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7`
- Memory: `16 GB 2667 MHz DDR4`

- `Proof generation time (with witness)` - time to generate witness from input and write to file included

- `Proof generation time (without witness)` - time to generate witness from input and write to file excluded
